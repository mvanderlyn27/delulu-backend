## 2. Key Features & User Flows

### 2.1 Story Creation Workflow

#### A. Entry Mode Selection
- **Manual Entry**: Users manually define characters, attributes, and story parameters.
- **Automagic Entry**: AI auto-generates details based on uploaded images or character names.

#### B. Character Creation
- **Manual Flow**:
  1. **Character 1 Setup**: Upload image, name, age, personality traits, role in story.
  2. **Character 2 Setup**: Repeat for additional characters.
  3. **Relationships**: Define dynamics between characters (e.g., allies, rivals, lovers).
- **Automagic Flow**:
  1. Upload a photo or enter a name → AI analyzes image (e.g., facial features, mood) or scrapes name associations (e.g., historical/mythological figures) to prefill attributes.
  2. User can edit AI-generated details.

#### C. Story Configuration
- **Template Selection**: Pre-built story types (e.g., "Fantasy Quest," "Romantic Drama," "Mystery Thriller").
- **Custom Attributes**:
  - Genre, tone (e.g., playful, dark), setting (e.g., medieval castle, cyberpunk city).
  - Desired story length (short, medium, epic).
  - Content filters (e.g., explicit vs. suggestive for erotic content).

#### D. Story Generation
- **Backend Process**:
  1. Send user inputs (characters, story attributes) to LLM (MVP Use Gemini 2.0 Flash, Moving forward use a custom abliterated model for NSFW) via API.
  2. Generate story text with branching decision points.
  3. Use Stable Diffusion/DALL-E to create setting/character scene images.
- **User Interaction**:
  - At decision points, users input actions (e.g., "Kiss Character X," "Flee the scene").
  - Story dynamically adjusts based on choices.

#### E. Post-Story Actions
- **Share**: Export as text/stylized image, share via social media, or generate a replayable link.
- **Replay**: Restart story to explore alternate paths.
- **Edit**: Return to setup to modify characters/story parameters for new outcomes.

  - Image generation API Imagegen2 from google.
  - **Database**: Store user profiles, story drafts, and character assets. Uses Firebase for database, and authentication

### 3.2 Frontend
- **Responsive UI**: Compatible with desktop/mobile, with an emphasis on mobile-first design.

- **Age Verification**: Gate erotic content behind age confirmation.
- **Content Moderation**:
  - AI filters for illegal/non-consensual themes.
  - User flagging system for inappropriate stories.

  **Mitigation**: Fine-tune LLM with adventure-story datasets.
- **Risk**: High compute costs for image generation.
  **Mitigation**: Cache frequently used scenes; offer premium tiers.
